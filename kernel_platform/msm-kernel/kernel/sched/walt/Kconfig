config SCHED_WALT
	tristate "Support window based load tracking"
	depends on SMP
	help
	This feature will allow the scheduler to maintain a tunable window
	based set of metrics for tasks and runqueues. These metrics can be
	used to guide task placement as well as task frequency requirements
	for cpufreq governors.

config SCHED_WALT_DEBUG
	tristate "WALT debug module"
	depends on SCHED_WALT
	select TRACE_PREEMPT_TOGGLE
	select TRACE_IRQFLAGS
	help
	  This module provides the means of debugging long preempt and
	  irq disable code. This helps in identifying the scheduling
	  latencies. The module rely on preemptirq trace hooks and
	  print the stacktrace to the ftrace upon long preempt and irq
	  events. Sysctl knobs are available for the user to configure
	  the thresholds.

	  This module also used to crash the system to catch issues
	  in scenarios like RT throttling and sleeping while in atomic
	  context etc.

config SCHED_CONSERVATIVE_BOOST_LPM_BIAS
	bool "Enable LPM bias if conservative boost is enabled"
	default n
	help
	  This feature will allow the scheduler to disable low power
	  modes on a cpu if conservative boost is active. The cpu
	  will not enter low power mode for a hysteresis time period,
	  which can be configured from userspace.

config RQ_STAT_SHOW
	bool "Enable rq_stat node to check each Cluster's number of task"
	default n
	help
	  This feature creats "/proc/rq_stat" node.
	  It's read only node.
	  shows number of task in each Cluster's rq.
	  first is little cluster and last one is gold/gold+ cluster

config SCHED_POWER_OPTIMIZE
	bool "Enable Power optimize tunning feature"
	default n
	help
	  This feature make "up_delay_freq" sysfs node in Walt Governor.
	  Also, change prediction target load from 80 to 90
	  when conservative prediction load enable condition.
	  if we enable and apply some value,
	  we can make overall system power better.
