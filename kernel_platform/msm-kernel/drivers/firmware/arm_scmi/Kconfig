	help
	  ARM System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) protocol is a
	  set of operating system-independent software interfaces that are
	  used in system management. SCMI is extensible and currently provides
	  interfaces for: Discovery and self-description of the interfaces
	  it supports, Power domain management which is the ability to place
	  a given device or domain into the various power-saving states that
	  it supports, Performance management which is the ability to control
	  the performance of a domain that is composed of compute engines
	  such as application processors and other accelerators, Clock
	  management which is the ability to set and inquire rates on platform
	  managed clocks and Sensor management which is the ability to read
	  sensor data, and be notified of sensor value.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCMI.
